# Things to Try

This is a collection of exercises and activities that are designed to satisfy a bunch of useful criteria:

1. They should always be achievable unless you are in some way actively prevented from achieving them, to the point that struggling to do them when you usually can should be taken as diagnostic that you're not in a good state right now.
2. They should not be too time consuming - twenty minutes maximum, but ideally much less.
3. They should be moderately life improving, or at least better than doom scrolling, watching TV, etc.
4. They should be things that are endlessly repeatable, possibly by making them harder as you get used to them.

Ideally when you find yourself at a loss for what to do you should be able to just pick up an arbitrary one of these exercises, do that, and have your day be slightly improved thereby.

Currently they're mostly designed with an audience and user base of one, me, but I'd really like other people to try them out and let me know how they find them. Please do, and please file issues with questions, comments, ideas, etc.

I'd rather not accept pull requests for anything more than typo corrections etc as I've vague plans to do stuff with this that make it important that I retain ownership of it.
