# Body Check In

This is an exercise that works on writing and observational skills, and helps you be more aware of your body and how it feels.
You might find it easier to to start with [Describe an object](/things/describe-an-object.md) first as practice.

The exercise is this: Write a page (I use an A4 page but feel free to pick something smaller or larger) describing the current state of your body. You should especially focus on how it feels, and you should especially *avoid* writing about how it looks, or making value judgements. Focus on things like whether anything hurts, how energetic you feel, points of stiffness, any positives. Feel free to move around, especially when you notice stiffness - e.g. if you notice your shoulders are stiff, try rolling your shoulders and see how that feels, then write about that. Note down anything you observe that you think is interesting about how you're holding your body.

Variations:

* If you've done a general body check in already, try focusing on a particular body part, e.g. an arm or a leg, or your neck and go into more detail about that.
* Focus heavily on movement and range of movement - what feels possible, what doesn't.
* Rather than focusing on how your body feels from the inside, try touching it with a hand and see what you can notice that way - e.g. any sore spots, dry skin, etc.
