# Brain Dump

This is a simple [free writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing) technique that's useful for getting you unstuck or clarifying your thoughts on a topic.

You take a sheet of A4 paper, and write down everything you can think to write down about the subject until you've filled the page. It doesn't have to be good, or coherent, you just have to write it down.

Tip: If you are stuck as to what to write, try elaborating on something you've already written, or write down how you feel about the subject. e.g. what's annoying you.

Variations:

* You can increase the amount if you think you have a lot you want to figure out.
* You don't *have* to have a set topic and can just brain dump about whatever you like.
