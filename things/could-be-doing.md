# Things I Could Be Doing

This is an exercise in generating ideas and it's also a good way to potentially highlight some anxiety areas and get yourself unstuck from a rut by highlighting possibilities.

The exercise is this: Write out a list of things you could potentially do right now. They should be relatively small (completable in an hour at most ideally), and your list should contain at least 10, and ideally more, items (I try to fill a side of A4).

Importantly, the list doesn't have to be things you feel like you should do, or that you want to do, it just has to be possible for you to do them and vaguely plausible that you would. It can be a mix of work things, exercises, fun things, you can (and probably should) even include things that you'd like to avoid doing like "doomscroll on Twitter", or things that you are finding actively aversive like "do my taxes". Feel free to include activities from this collection that you like on the list.
The longer the list you can manage the better.

Tip: The important thing about lists like this is that the list doesn't have to be particularly good. Do not try to filter out at all - if something occurs to you to put on the list, put it on the list. If you find yourself utterly stuck, try setting out to put deliberately faintly ridiculous things on the list.

Variations:

* You can try restricting it to some subcategory (e.g. "work things I could do", "things I could do that would make me feel better")
* After you've written the list, try going back over it. Cross out anything you are definitely not going to do. See what's left. Does any of it actively appeal? If so, do the thing.
