# Describe an Object

This is an exercise that works on writing and observational skills, and helps you be more aware of the level of detail found in your environment.

Pick some mundane object that you have near to hand, and write a page of observations about it - try to keep it mostly concrete, but feel free to include any thoughts sparked by it, history of the object, etc.

Variations:

* How you write about it - I prefer to handwrite it on a side of A4, but you can also do this electronically if you like. You could even speak out loud for a set period of time.
* How much you write.
* What sort of object you pick!

Tip: If you're struggling to find enough to write, try interacting with it in various ways and with varying different senses. How does it feel to hold? Can you smell anything about them? Do they make a noise when you move them? Try focusing in on details - if you've described some aspect of them, try focusing in on it more and saying more about it.

That being said, the main tip is to just get started, you'll probably find it's much easier than you expect it to be.
