# Jump Up and Down

This is a useful mini bit of cardio exercise that is surprisingly good for getting your heart rate up without getting too sweaty. This is often useful as a bit of a brain reset when feeling brain foggy.

It does require you to be willing to look a bit foolish and probably make some noise though. 

The exercise is this: Literally just jump up and down in place until you are tired of doing so.

Variations:

* If you want to make it both a bit more work and also to look a bit more like a proper exercise you can do star jumps instead.
* Just doing a standing in place jump you can vary whether you mostly use your feet or are also bending your knees for a higher jump.
* I prefer to do this barefoot but you might want to try both with and without shoes.
