# Lie Down and Listen

This is a good thing to do when you'd quite like a nap but napping is hard, or you'd quite like to meditate but meditating is even harder.
It's also good as a precursor practice to that that lets you skip over the hard bits.

The exercise is to lie down on the floor semi-supine (this is an Alexander Technique thing. [The position is explained well here](https://alexandertechnique.co.uk/learning-it/semi-supine) but skip the attention bits).
Put on a podcast, or audiobook, or some music if you like just listening to music (I don't), close your eyes, and just focus on listening to it for a while.
Try to keep your attention on whatever you're listening to, but it's not a big deal if your mind wanders.

You can either listen to an entire episode if it's a short podcast, or set a timer, or do anything else to keep time. Importantly, you can also stop whenever you like - if you start to feel restless or bored, stop, don't force yourself to continue. Lying down with your eyes closed for even a moment is success at this activity, though longer periods will tend to be more restorative.

Tip: Spend a little time getting the head support right. It's easy to make it too high. I use a ream of printer paper that I had lying around for this as it's easy to adjust it to exactly the right height.

Variations:

* Varying what you listen to while doing this.
* If lying semi-supine on the floor doesn't work for you you can always try lying down on a bed. Try semi-supine first though.
* You can also try doing this without anything to listen to, but at that point you're basically meditating. This is fine if that's what you want to do, but is a bit of a different thing.
