# Problems Inventory

This is another inventory taking exercise: Try to write down all your problems (or at least a lot of them). See if you can fill an A4 page with discrete problems, by repeatedly going "Everything is fine except what is currently on the page..." every time you're struggling to think of more, and seeing what naturally comes up. Try to be as concrete as possible, and feel free to write down things that are more specific versions of something you've already written, or variations on a theme, etc.

Once you are done, put a star next to anything you've written down that you feel seems pretty solvable actually.

Variations:

* Scope this to problems in a particular category (living situation, work, a relationship, etc)
* Pick one of your starred items and do a [brain dump](/things/brain-dump.md) about it.
