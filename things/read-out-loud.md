# Read Out Loud

This is an exercise that occupies your attention for a bit, possibly helps you learn something, and helps practice a useful skill.

The exercise is this: Pick up a book (a physical book is best) and turn to a random page in it. Read it out loud, starting from the first complete sentence, and finishing the last sentence even if it goes on to the next page.

Reading out loud is a really nice skill to have and helps one develop one's conversational and public speaking skills, and it's good to exercise your voice a bit besides.

It's also good to read, and I think we all think we can't read because we keep getting distracted midway through, or get stuck on whether we're understanding it. Reading out loud essentially takes over our focus, so it's much harder to get distracted from the actual task, and removes any obligation to concentrate on understanding material because the goal is how it sounds.

Variations:

* Try paying attention to how your voice sounds. Is your rhythm natural? Does your reading voice sound like your speaking voice?
* Try reading more than one page.
* Occasionally pause and rephrase what you just said in your own words.
* Try recording yourself as you do this and listening to it on playback (I highly recommend this one, but it's a bit uncomfortable)
