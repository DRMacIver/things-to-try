# Throw and Catch a Ball

This is a very simple exercise that is mostly a hand-eye coordination development thing, but also is a pleasantly meditative activity.

The exercise is this:

1. Take a ball (I use a tennis ball, but if you want something less bouncy try a juggling ball) and throw it up into the air.
2. Catch it.
3. Repeat as many times as you like (it may be useful to set a number in advance - 30 is a good number)

You can make this as easy or as hard as you like. It's better to start easy.

Variations:

* Whether you use the same hand or a different one to catch it.
* Whether you catch it with your dominant or non-dominant hand.
* How high you throw it.
* Whether you let it fall into an open hand or try to snatch it out of the air.
* Different types of ball.
* Set challenges - e.g. how long can you go without dropping it?

Importantly, which variation you try is not a criterion for success - you can do whatever you feel up to at a given moment. If you are getting frustrated because the exercise is more difficult than you want it to be, make it easier.

Here's a tip: Keep your eye on the ball at all times while doing this. *Don't* watch your hand, watch the ball. If you are struggling with the basic exercise, try focusing on just watching the ball. Throw it up in the air and *don't* try to catch it, just track the ball wiht your gaze as it falls and bounces.
